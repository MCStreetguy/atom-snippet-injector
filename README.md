# Atom Snippet Injector
**An easy but powerful snippet management tool for Atom editor.**
This atom package provides a JSON based snippet management without any difficult UIs or file syntaxes.
Just select the text you want to store in a snippet, run the `snippet-injector:create` command (either through context menu, hotkey or command palette), enter a title and your snippet is good to go.
To insert it back in the editor run the `snippet-injector:insert` command. choose the snippet and it gets inserted at you current marker(s).
Happy coding :)
