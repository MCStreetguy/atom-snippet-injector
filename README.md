# Atom Snippet Injector
**An easy but powerful snippet management tool for Atom editor.**
This atom package provides a JSON based snippet management.

*But why use this package* you ask?

Because you can reach every feature in more or less three steps.

It's easy and fast so you don't have to struggle with difficult UI's or file syntaxes or even worse, writing the snippets manually.
Check out the [Quick Start Guide](HOWTO.md#examples) for more instructions on how to use this package.
Happy Coding :)
