# Atom Snippet Injector
**An easy but powerful snippet management tool for Atom editor.**

This atom package provides a JSON based, local snippet management, [automated synchronization](#atom-sync) to Atom's integrated snippet-module and [database support](#database-support) for improved teamwork with consistent snippet access.
It's easy and fast so you don't have to struggle with difficult UI's or file syntaxes or even worse, define the snippets manually.

## Introduction
Snippet Injector basically provides four functions for snippet management.
[Create](#creation), [Insert](#insertion), [Update](#updating) and [Delete](#deletion). They all do exactly what they are called, depending on your configuration, with some extra magic.

All commands are available through the main application menu below `Packages` > `Snippet Injector`.
The context menu provides the [Delete](#deletion) command in the whole workspace while [creation]((#creation)), [insertion](#insertion) and [updating](#updating) is only available within a TextEditor instance.

### Creation
To create a snippet, just mark all the text that shall be stored as snippet and run the [`snippet-injector:create`](#snippet-injectorcreate) command through command palette, context or main menu or hotkey. You will be prompted for a title for the snippet.   
Within this input field you may use some additional markers:   
- All words starting with a hash (`#foo`) are treated as keywords and taken out of the actual title.   
- A part of the title, wrapped in square brackets, defines the prefix that triggers the snippet in autocompletion. Only the brackets will be removed from the actual title.

### Insertion
To insert a snippet, just place the cursor where you want it to appear and run the [`snippet-injector:insert`](#snippet-injectorinsert) command the way you prefer. You will be prompted to choose a snippet for insertion, also allowing you to search the list. In the search field you may use the following syntax:   
- Plain text searches the title of the snippets   
- A word starting with a hash (`#foo`) searches for keywords   
- A word starting with an at-sign (`@bar`) searches for author Â 

The options can be combined together. Snippets are filtered by full-text-search, meaning the order of the search keywords needs to be the same as in the title otherwise the Snippets won't match your search. (This will be improved soon.)

### Updating
To update a snippets content, just mark all the text that shall be used as new content and run the [`snippet-injector:update`](#snippet-injectorupdate) command the way you prefer. You will be prompted to choose a snippet that shall be updated. This list is also searchable with the above mentioned options.

### Deletion
To delete a snippet, just run the [`snippet-injector:delete`](#snippet-injectordelete) command the way you prefer. You will be prompted to choose a Snippet in a dropdown list. Before actually deleting a snippet you will be prompted a second time if you are sure.

## Features

### Stats
While using Snippet Injector it may occur that you collect a whole bunch of snippets. To keep the insertion prompt handy even with a lot of data, there are stats recorded for each snippet. Especially the usage count takes effect as it defines the order in which the snippets are listed so you got the mostly used ones at the top of the list and can access them faster.

### Import / Export
Through the main application menu below `Packages` > `Snippet Injector` you can access the import and export functionality.

The `Export Storage` option is intended to create backups of you local storage or if you want to migrate it to a new system.   
The `Export Snippet(s)` option allows you to specify several snippets that you want to export. This was intended to share snippets with others without a database connection.   
The `Import Snippet(s)` option obviously imports snippets from an export back in the storage.

### Atom-Sync
You can enable synchronization with Atom's snippet module in the package config.

![atom sync config option](https://image.prntscr.com/image/NlQPlp6fQGmLvA8FLkuilQ.png)

When activated, all of your snippets will be synchronized with the `snippets.cson` file. Within this file you can define snippets for fast insertion in Atom. This feature is provided by the core-package `snippets`.  
Writing a CSON file manually is laborious but Snippet Injector automatically generates the needed structure including language scopes and configurable keywords.

When you get prompted for a snippet title you can wrap a part of it in square brackets. This will be used as keyword in autocompletion so you can give your snippets significant names without having to type all of it when inserting it.

You can use [Atom's snippet tabstop syntax](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/#snippet-format) in snippets. This functionality is only available when inserting through autocompletion. When inserting with the insert command the tabstop markers are stripped from the snippets content, leaving possible default values.

### Database Support
Snippet Injector supports [Apache CouchDB v2.1](http://couchdb.apache.org/) as additional storage.

![couchdb config option](https://image.prntscr.com/image/WLz8O4VdTDCG4zLdAYQFIQ.png)

When enabled, you can mark snippets as shared, meaning they will be stored and synchronized with the CouchDB Server. A database called `snippet-injector-data` will be created, if not already done. The options for authentication can be left empty if you don't need authentication for your server. (Snippet Injector currently only supports [Basic Authentication](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.0/api/server/authn.html#basic-authentication))

All snippets stored in the database can be used by everyone you give access to the server. That's why this is just an additional storage method, because you possibly don't want to share every snippet with others.

For security reasons, editing of snippets is only permitted to the respective owner, stored in the snippet. The author field is set to the current user account name when creating a snippet. This is no secure protection but prevents snippets from being overwritten or deleted by other users. You may insert a snippet, modify it to your needs and create a new one if needed.

Whenever an error occurs you will be notified through Atom. If possible, there is an option for performing automated repair methods.

![example error notification](https://image.prntscr.com/image/xHqFsydzSw6R0byBhbWPaQ.png)

**Use the `Fix Sync Problems` button on your own risk!**  The repair algorithm checks each local snippet for errors with database meta information and synchronization process and resets it's meta if needed. This results in the snippet being treated as unsynchronized and uploaded to the database as a whole new document, what fixes the most common errors.
It may occur that snippet data gets duplicated.

If this option is not available, normally there should be a `Retry` button instead. It appears that you just misspelled something in the config so whenever an error occurs, check your config and if the server is reachable then click `Retry`.
