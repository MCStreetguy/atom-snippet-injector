# Atom Snippet Injector
**An easy but powerful snippet management tool for Atom editor.**
This atom package provides a JSON based snippet management without any difficult UIs or file syntaxes.
Just select the text you want to store in a snippet, run the `atom-snippet-injector:create` command (either through context menu, hotkey or command palette), enter a title and your snippet is good to go.
