## Using the snippet-injector

### Create
(_[Reference](README.md#commands)_)

Select the text that you want to store as a snippet.
Open up the context menu and click on `Create Snippet from selection`.

Enter a useful title for the snippet and confirm.
*(Bare in mind that you need to recognize your snippet by this title)*

### Update
(_[Reference](README.md#commands)_)

>Please bare in mind that this command overrides snippet contents, ignoring if there is any relation between the old and new content.
It may occur that you damage snippets so be careful with this option. I recommend inserting the snippet in a new EditorPane before editing.

Select the updated content of one snippet.
Open the context menu and click on `Update existing snippet`.

[ ![](/wiki/update_step_1-small.png) (full screenshot)](http://prntscr.com/g3yl1v)

Choose the snippet you want to update. *(This is the same prompt used for insertion)*

[ ![](/wiki/update_step_2-small.png) (full screenshot)](http://prntscr.com/g3ylan)

The snippet's content is now updated to whatever you selected.
*A notification tells you about errors and success.*

### Delete
(_[Reference](README.md#commands)_)

Open up the context menu and click on `Delete Snippet`.

[ ![](/wiki/delete_step_1-small.png) (full screenshot)](http://prntscr.com/fzczas)

Choose the snippet you want to delete from the dropdown-list. Choosing one confirms the prompt automatically.
*(You will be prompted twice before actual deletion. Bare in mind that deleted snippets are gone forever!)*
